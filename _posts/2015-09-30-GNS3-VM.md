Playing around again with gns3 and the new items around about.

Client Version: 1.4.0b3

GNS3 VM Version: 1.3.10

Download for GNS3-VM: [GNS3 VM](https://github-cloud.s3.amazonaws.com/releases/33236425/248e68c0-62c1-11e5-8d9d-5655f0ef33f0.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIMWPLRQEC4XCWWPA%2F20150927%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20150927T022335Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=90b70e2ad314a9be55608f0490ea93889636b03d3e50b674fa991f78a0431d40&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3DGNS3.VM.VirtualBox.0.9.6.zip&response-content-type=application%2Foctet-stream)

Unzip and import OVA into VirtualBox

I had to upgrade the GNS client to 1.4 in order to use the GNS3 VM.

The 1.4 client has a new section where you select 'Server' under GNS3->Preferences->Server->GNS3 VM.

Once selected to enable it will ask and walk through setup.

A common error that I received everytime I turn up the box is 'Not IP address could be found in GNS3 VM for eth1'

![GNS3-VM-Error]({{site.url}}/img/GNS3-VM-Error.png)

Once the GNS3 vm loads up the configuration panel looks like the following:

![GNS3-VM-Vobx]({{site.url}}/img/GNS3-VM-Vbox.png)

***I have not been able to utilize the VM***
