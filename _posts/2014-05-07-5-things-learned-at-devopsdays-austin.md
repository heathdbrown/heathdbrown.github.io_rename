A quick post on the 5 things I took away from DevOpsDays Austin 2014.

1. Business is everything!

2. Monitoring still sucks.

   Discovered that monitoring is still something left to be desired and everyone struggles with these types of problems.  While we were having DevOps, somewhere else there was Monitorama <http://monitorama.com/>, pretty inspiring to have a whole conferenced dedicated to the idea of Monioring.

3. CAMS

   Yet, another acronym I did not know.

   Culture
   Automation
   Measurement
   Sharing

4. OpenSpaces

   Since, this was my first real technical conference and I was pleasantly surprised with the concept of OpenSpaces.  OpenSpaces, is the idea of topics being discussed by the participants of the conference in a smaller group setting. These are also known as Breakout Sessions.

   OpenSpaces were a nice way to engage the audience and learn from peers experiencing the same types of problems.

   Just a few of the OpenSpaces I attended:

   * Infrastructure Behavioral Driven Development
   * ChatOps
   * On/Off Premise Cloud
   * Statsd/Graphite
   * Puppet
   * Kanban

5. I am behind on my reading list

   My notepad had quite a few books to be added to my reading list.

   * The Book of Five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi
   * Kanban by David Anderson
   * Phoenix Project by Gene Kim
   * Continuous Delivery by Jez Humble
   * Good to Great by Jim Collins
   * The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement by Eliyahu M. Goldratt 
   * Beyond the Goal: Eliyahu Goldratt Speaks on the Theory of Constraints Eliyahu M. Goldratt 
   * The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses Eric Ries 
   * Out of the Crisis by W. Edwards Deming
